				<h4>Abstract:</h4>
				<p>I began my research life as field biologist/wildlife ecologist working with endangered birds across the Southeast.  After roughly 20 years of moving through increasingly computational positions, I recently started a new position as an Assistant Professor of Computational Biology at LSU.  I'll discuss how my research led me from the field, to the lab, to the (super-)computer and back again. Throughout the talk, I'll discuss my work and how computational analyses play a significant part in what I do, and I'll offer several suggestions for biology students to become more computationally literate and for computer science students to become more biologically literate.</p>

<h4>Bio:</h4><p>Brant Faircloth is an Assistant Professor of Computational Biology at Louisiana State University.  His research focuses on understanding the causes and consequences of genetic diversity in a variety of non-model organisms, and his laboratory uses molecular and computation techniques to address questions in this area.</p>
