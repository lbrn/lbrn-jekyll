<p>Each year the LBRN program has an annual meeting in which program participants, committee members and administrators meet to review individual research accomplishments and to discuss the overall program activity. Summer research faculty and graduate and undergraduate students are encouraged to present their LBRN sponsored research, and talks are scheduled to highlight sponsored research projects from partnered campuses across the state. This year's meeting is being held on January 26 - January 28, 2018 in Shreveport, Louisiana at the LSU Health Science Center.
