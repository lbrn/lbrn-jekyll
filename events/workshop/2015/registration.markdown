    If you require hotel lodging, you must reserve your hotel room by October 20th to obtain state rates. Please contact Mrs. Terri Gilbert at, <a href="mailto:tgilbert@lsu.edu">tgilbert@lsu.edu</a> to secure a hotel reservation. After that date, you must procure your own lodging at your own expense.
