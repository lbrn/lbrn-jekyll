## Molecular and Cell Biology Resources Core

The Molecular and Cell Biology Resources Core (MCBRC) serves as the primary support unit for biomedical research in the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network and is expected to provide the bulk of training and support to PUI investigators, including managing the biweekly Works in Progress sessions. MCBR-supported research provides an essential link between important fields of biomedical sciences such as genetics, developmental biology, immunology, neurobiology, and cancer biology that impact public health.
