          Below are the details for your oral presentations (please see the agenda for the assigned time) at the Annual Meeting on Saturday, January 21, 2017. The Full project PI's are invited to give a 20 minute presentation highlighting the progress of their LBRN research project during the past year. As indicated, in the suggested presentation outline below, this presentation is different from a presentation normally made at a research meeting and must be designed to summarize your project and what has been acomplished during the past summer. After the presentations, the Full Project PI's will have an opportunity to meet with the LBRN EAC regarding their research project.
