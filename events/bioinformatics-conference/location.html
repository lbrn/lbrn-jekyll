			<br>Directions to the 2018 Conference - the conference is being held within the LSU Digital Media Center. When you enter the building (follow the signs when you approach the building to the front door, there is a round reception desk, go to the right down the hall to the conference room. There are restrooms nearby.
	
	Baton Rouge Traffic is notoriously difficult in the morning across the I-10 Mississippi bridge if you're coming from the north, actually taking the old bridge is a viable alternative. Coming from New Orleans or I-12, we recommend taking the Acadian Exit to go down Stanford and then by the lakes, and then turning left in front of the LSU Emerging Tech Center and then right into the Parking Lot for CCT. Be sure NOT to park in any red marked lots, the regular spaces are fine.
	
	<br><br><b>Do NOT Park on lake side of building.</b><br><br>
