### *LBRN Summer Research Program Eligibility*

**Who is eligible?**
 

* Students who are attending a university or college in the state of Louisiana, except LSU Baton Rouge and Tulane students.
 

* Students who are not graduating between January through August of 2018.
 

 
 

### *LBRN Summer Research Program dates 2018*

**What are the program dates?**
  

* The program will run from tentatively May 21 â€“ July 27, 2018 for Undergraduate and Graduate student participants.
 

* Dates for Faculty participants may be flexible, need to be stated in your proposal application.
 

* Due to the limited availability of housing during the summer, adjustments cannot be made to the start and end dates of the program to accommodate students with other scheduling conflicts.
 

 
 

### *Full Term*

**Am I required to be on the LSU campus (or other research facility) for the full term?**
 

* Yes. Ten weeks may sound like a long time, but it is a very short period in which to do any meaningful research. Undergraduates must attend the opening meetings and participate in the poster session on the final day. You will also be required to attend weekly seminar meetings.
 

 
 

### *Undergraduate Work*
 

**What hours do I work?**
 

* Since the LSU LBRN Summer Research Program is probably an undergraduate's first attempt at real scientific research, it is hard to explain the variability. You will be expected to work when the work needs to be done. Experiments don't always run on the timescale we'd like them to. You must be willing to work some late nights and lots of weekends.
 

 
 

### *Apartment Housing*

**Can I live off campus?**
 

* Yes, you may live anywhere you would like; however, our program can only pay for housing within the proscribed Campus Apartments or Dorms for students working at one of our approved mentoring institutions per the application.
 

* If you reside in the same city as the mentoring institution; for students who currently live at home or already have an apartment in the mentoring city, please stay there and we cannot reimburse rents.
 

 
 

### *School / Classes / Jobs*

**May I take classes or have another job during the summer program?**
 

* No. Ten weeks may sound like a long time, but it is a very short period in which to do any meaningful research. You will be working with your group and may not have free time; therefore, we do not allow student researchers to take classes or hold an outside job. You must be willing to devote your entire attention to the program.
 

 
 

### *Letter Recommendation Solicit*
 

**From whom should I solicit Letters of Recommendation?**
 

* Your recommendation letters are very important. They should all be from faculty members who know you quite well. If somebody can only say that you made an ""A"" in their class, you've wasted a letter because we can look at your transcripts and know that. Two of your letters need to be from science faculty members, and one of these may be from your proposed mentor. Recommendation letters have to be submitted through our application process. See the Summer Research Program Letters of Recommendation page for instructions and the link to provide to your faculty to LBRN@lsu.edu.
 

 
 

### *Mentor Professor Project*

**How do I choose a mentor professor and a project?**
 

* You are ultimately responsible for choosing your mentor and project. You will need to contact faculty members directly to ask about working with them. If you have any questions, please contact the LBRN office by email lbrn@lsu.edu.
 

* There is a prospective mentor list for Undergraduate, Graduate and Faculty Researchers listed under: Summer Research Mentors, that page is also for those Faculty at research institutions who wish to mentor students. The list gets updated frequently through the end of year as we refresh the list, mentors have to sign back up each year so the list is current.
 

* When the mentor confirms to mentor you for the summer, this does not guarantee you being selected for the program, only available slot in his/her lab.
 

 
 

### *Training*
 

  
**What type of training will I receive?**
 

* An individual research project will be assigned to you by your mentor (Undergraduates).
 

* Training on and first-hand use of state-of-the-art laboratory instrumentation will be provided.
 

* Group instruction will also be provided in general research issues and practices such as scientific ethics, chemical and radiation safety, laboratory notebook keeping, print and on-line scientific literature searches, presentation of research results, and scientific writing.
 

 
 

### *Program Activities*
 

**What are some of the activities planned for the program?**
 

* A welcome dinner
 

* Tours to research facilities
 

* A softball game and lunch
 

* Weekly seminars by program mentors
