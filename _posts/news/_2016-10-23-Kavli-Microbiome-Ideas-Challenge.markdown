This Ideas Challenge invites the broad scientific community – including microbiologists, nanoscientists, neuroscientists, engineers, chemists, materials scientists, physicists and others – to submit innovative, blue-sky, and aspirational ideas for novel experimental tools and methods for understanding microbial function. The Challenge will be managed and judged through a collaboration of three leading scientific societies – led by the [American Society for Microbiology](http://www.asm.org), in partnership with the [American Chemical Society](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en.html) and the [American Physical Society](http://www.aps.org). The [Kavli Foundation](http://www.kavlifoundation.org) will award $1M for recipients to launch their innovate research ideas. 

The focus of the Microbiome Ideas Challenge is the development of new tools and methods that will help transition the field of microbiome research from correlative studies – i.e., genomics-driven microbial censusing efforts – to causal understanding of microbial function. Ideally, ideas for novel tools and methods will be broadly applicable across the many environments studied in microbiome research – the Earth’s soils, ocean and freshwater environments, and atmosphere; as well as animal hosts’ gut and skin ecosystems.
