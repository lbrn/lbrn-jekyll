    There is a 15 person limit on the event, which has been reached - but you can still register on wait list for future trainings or if space opens up. The deadline for registration will be for accomodating lodging for the participant (if registered by May 17th deadline). After that date, if you were not wait listed you will have to procure your own lodging.
