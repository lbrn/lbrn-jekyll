## Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, and Computational Biology Core

The Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, and Computational Biology Core (BBCC) serves to train and support project investigators and their teams across Louisiana. It is structured around four subunits that work together to enable Louisiana Biomedical Research Network (LBRN) project PIs and their teams to employ Louisiana cyberinfrastructure (especially high performance computing), and to provide bioinformatics services, training, and educational support.

## Services

#### Cyberinfrastructure and Biomedical Data Analytics (CBDA) Subunit lead - Dr. Park, support Dr. N. Kim & Dr. J. Kim

CBDA enables biomedical data research—especially for big biomedical data contexts—over Louisiana cyberinfrastructure (e.g., LONI networks and HPC clusters: Supermike-II, SuperMic, Queenbee-II, etc.). CBDA provides software solutions to PUI investigators who need to run big biomedical data applications (e.g. de novo genome assemblers and alignment tools, etc.) on HPC clusters.

#### Biomedical Data Mining and Biostatistics (BDMB) Subunit lead - Dr. Dua, support Dr. Thompson and Dr. Chowriappa

BDMB focuses on creating advanced data mining algorithmic solutions to analyze large biomedical and biological datasets. The advent of automated data collection instrumentation and next-generation sequencing presents a growing need for data mining and scalable biostatistical techniques. Such biomedical data is typically heterogeneous, highdimensional, and complex. Traditional data analysis techniques underperform as a consequence of the computational challenges posed by data dimensionality and velocity. Validating results and inferences drawn from analyzing these large datasets also poses challenges, confounding establishment of significance in biological contexts. These factors pose a growing need for novel data mining algorithms and techniques that are scalable, reliable, and interpretable.

#### Biomedical Visualization and Interaction (BVI) Subunit lead - Dr Cvek, support Dr. Ullmer, Philip Kilgore

Visual analytics tools enabling the display and interaction with biomedical data are crucial to data exploration and actionable follow-up. The expertise contributed by the CBDA and BDMB subunits extends conventional statistical methodologies to newer data analysis methods including visual data mining and visual analytics of big biomedical data. The BVI subunit will support and extend visual analytics expertise at LBRN PUIs and peer BBCC sites.

#### Communications Infrastructure and Training (CIT) Subunit lead - John Quebedeaux.

A central objective and role of the overall LBRN project is bridging geographical distance to increase the effective critical mass, interchange, and impact of biomedical domain expertise. The CIT subunit serves a crosscutting enablement role between all three LBRN cores and the personnel of our PUI project teams.
