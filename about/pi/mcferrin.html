abstract: |
  Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infects approximately 90% of humans worldwide. HSV-1 infection and subsequent replication induce inflammation and blood vessel growth in the cornea of the eye leading to corneal blindness. In the United States, HSV infection is the leading cause of infection-induced blindness, and nearly 20,000 new cases are reported yearly.    

  Cyclin-dependent kinases are involved in cell cycle control and/or regulation of transcription. In the 1990s, cyclin-dependent kinases were discovered to be required for herpesvirus transcription and replication. More recently, two laboratories reported that cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9) and its downstream target, serine 2 phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, are essential in HSV-1 transcription. To date there is little literature on the role of cyclin-dependent kinases in herpesvirus infection of the eye or on the efficacy of CDK inhibitors in preventing HSV-1 associated ocular neovascularization and its consequences.

  The purpose of this proposal is to examine the role of Cdk9 in corneal neovascularization. Dr. James M. Hill, the mentor on this project, is a successful biomedical research scientist with many years of experience investigating HSV-1 ocular infections using in vivo models. This project will examine the molecular mechanisms of HSV-1 corneal neovascularization, an important health issue worldwide.
