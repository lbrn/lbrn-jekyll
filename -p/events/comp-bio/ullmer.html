				<h4>Abstract:</h4>
				<p>Six years ago, NIH Director Francis Collins is reported to have said "It would not be good to have a $5,000 genome and a $500,000 analysis." Today, this can be argued to be an approximation of the case.  The present complexities and unknown future implications of such analyses loom large not only for scientists, but also for engagement by school children, senators, street people, solicitors -- each with 
increasingly complex, impactful nuances.

We will describe two intersecting research threads leading to tangible genomics collaborations with several local, national, and international partners.  One of these concerns engagement in human and non-human genome consortium projects.  We will describe collaborative experiences from computational analyses of several primate genome efforts.  In parallel, we will discuss several trajectories of synergistic research upon tangible interfaces. Specifically, we will focus upon emerging ecologies of mass market, high-end, and research prototypes; and upon applications to interactive computational STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics).</p>

<h4>Bio:</h4>
<p>Brygg Ullmer is the Effie C. and Donald M. Hardy associate professor at LSU, jointly in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and the Center for Computation and Technology (CCT).  He  leads CCT's Cultural Computing focus area (research division), with 15 faculty spanning six departments, and co-leads the Tangible Visualization group. He serves as director for the Louisiana Biomedical Research 
Network (LBRN) Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, and Computational Biology (BBC) Core.  Ullmer completed his Ph.D. at the MIT Media Laboratory (Tangible Media group) in 2002, where his research focused on tangible 
user interfaces.  He held a postdoctoral position in the visualization department of the Zuse Institute Berlin, internships at Interval Research (Palo Alto) and Sony CSL (Tokyo), and has been a visiting lecturer at Hong Kong Polytechnic's School of Design. His research interests include tangible interfaces, computational genomics (and more broadly, interactive computational STEAM), visualization, and rapid physical and electronic prototyping. He also has a strong interest in computationally-mediated art, craft, and design, rooted in the traditions and material expressions of specific regions and cultures.
