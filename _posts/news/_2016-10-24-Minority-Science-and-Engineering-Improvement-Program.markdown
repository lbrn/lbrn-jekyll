*Funding Uses*: This U.S. Department of Education program is designed to effect long-range improvement in science and engineering education at predominantly minority institutions and to increase the flow of underrepresented ethic minorities, particularly minority women, into scienctific and technological careers. There are four types of project grants: Institutional, special, cooperative, and design.

*General Eligibility Requirements*: Public and private nonprofit institutions of higher education that are minority institutions; nonprofit science-oriented organizations, professional scientific societies, and institutions of higher education that award baccalaureate degrees; and a consortium of organizations that provide needed services of one or more minority institutions.
