<p>The Louisiana Biomedical Research Network (LBRN) sponsors a summer research program in support of undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty from any Louisiana institute. We offer qualified participants the opportunity to work in established research laboratories at Louisiana State University, LSU Health Sciences Center in New Orleans, LSU Health Sciences Center in Shreveport, Tulane Medical Center, or Tulane National Primate Research Center. The goal of our program and funding is to support biomedical research through an increase in graduate school admissions in these scientific fields and make Louisiana researchers more competitive in obtaining federal funding for research.</p>

<p>The schedule for undergraduate students covers nine weeks during the summer; the 2016 summer program dates are May 23 – July 29, 2016 (tentative). The schedule for graduate students and faculty is more flexible. It is expected that an agreement be reached between the program participant (undergraduate student, graduate student or funded faculty) and the intended mentor. It is expected that the agreement to mentor an LBRN participant is a mutual one between the intended mentor and the funded participant.</p>

<p>The LBRN program expects that our participants perform full time research for the period of funding. We do not allow for other jobs, teaching or classes or vacations to be scheduled during the funding period; fellowships (undergraduate students), stipends (graduate students), and summer salaries (faculty) are sufficient to enable the funded participant to focus 100% on the research project during the funding period. The student participant may become involved in a research project that is ongoing in the chosen laboratory, or design a project in collaboration with the intended mentor.</p>

<p>As the mentor of an undergraduate student in our program, it is expected that you will oversee the training of the student participant and monitor their progress while they are working on the agreed upon project in your laboratory. As a mentor you can expect serious and professional work from your LBRN funded researcher while they are working in your laboratory. In addition to a wages to the undergraduate participant, we offer a supply fee of up to $1,000 per student to the research laboratory to help defer the cost of supplies for the funded project. Our undergraduate summer program culminates in the Summer Undergraduate Research Forum (SURF) where our program participants, along with other undergraduate summer research students across the campus, are invited to present their research in the form of a poster. It is expected that an LBRN funded undergraduate will receive guidance from their research laboratory in preparing this presentation and that a portion of the supply fee will be set aside to produce the poster.</p>

<p>As the mentor of a graduate student in our program, it is expected that you will oversee the training of the student and monitor their progress while they are in your laboratory. Our program participants are expected to work full time in the laboratory and on their agreed upon project. In addition to a stipend for the graduate participant, we offer a supply fee of up to $2,000 per student to the research laboratory to help defer the cost of supplies for the funded project. Our graduate summer program culminates in a written progress report of the research project as well as an oral presentation. It is expected that an LBRN funded graduate student will receive guidance from their research laboratory during their research period and in preparing the project report, and that the finished product be of a professional and scientific nature.</p>

<p>As the mentor of a faculty participant in our program it is expected that you will enter in to a collaborative relationship on an agreed upon project. You may expect to receive scientific and professional collaboration from the funded researcher. Equipment ordered for the funded research, unless otherwise specified, will belong to the funded researcher and will be housed at their home institution upon completion of the program funding period. You may also expect to have input in the determination of the requested supplies and equipment, which are part of the application process for faculty in our program. Our faculty summer program culminates in a written progress report of the research project. It is expected that an LBRN funded faculty researcher will receive guidance from their research laboratory and mentor in preparing this work and that the finished product be a professional progress report.</p>
