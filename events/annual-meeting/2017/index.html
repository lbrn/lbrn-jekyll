<p>Each year the LBRN program has an annual meeting in which program participants, committee members and administrators meet to review individual research accomplishments and to discuss the overall program activity. Summer research faculty and graduate and undergraduate students are encouraged to present their LBRN sponsored research, and talks are scheduled to highlight sponsored research projects from partnered campuses across the state. This year's meeting is being held on January 20 - January 22, 2017 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana at the Hilton Baton Rouge Capitol Center.
