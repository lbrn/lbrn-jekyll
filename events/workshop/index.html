	Baton Rouge Traffic is notoriously difficult in the morning across the I-10 Mississippi bridge if you're coming from the north, actually taking the old bridge is a viable alternative. Coming from New Orleans or I-12, we recommend taking the Acadian Exit to go down Stanford and then by the lakes, and then turning left in front of the LSU Emerging Tech Center and then right into the Parking Lot for CCT. Be sure NOT to park in any red marked lots, the regular spaces are fine.
	
	<br><br><b>Do NOT Park on lake side of building.</b><br><br>
