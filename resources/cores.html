<h3>Core Subunits</h3>
<div class="bio well">
       <h4>Cyberinfrastructure and Biomedical Data Analytics (CBDA)</h4>
       <p><strong>Subunit lead - Dr. Park, support Dr. N. Kim & Dr. J. Kim</strong><br>
       <p>CBDA enables biomedical data research—especially for big biomedical data contexts—over Louisiana cyberinfrastructure (e.g., Louisiana Optical Network Initiative (<a href="http://loni.org">LONI)</a> networks and High Performance Computing (<a href="http://hpc.lsu.edu">HPC</a>) clusters: Supermike-II, SuperMic, Queenbee-II, etc.). CBDA provides software solutions to PUI investigators who need to run big biomedical data applications (e.g. de novo genome assemblers and alignment tools, etc.) on HPC clusters.</p>
    </div>
    
<div class="bio well"> 
    <h4>Biomedical Data Mining and Biostatistics (BDMB)</h4>
    <p><strong>Subunit lead - Dr. Dua, support Dr. Thompson and Dr. Chowriappa</strong><br>

    <p>BDMB focuses on creating advanced data mining algorithmic solutions to analyze large biomedical and biological datasets. The advent of automated data collection instrumentation and next-generation sequencing presents a growing need for data mining and scalable biostatistical techniques. Such biomedical data is typically heterogeneous, highdimensional, and complex. Traditional data analysis techniques underperform as a consequence of the computational challenges posed by data dimensionality and velocity. Validating results and inferences drawn from analyzing these large datasets also poses challenges, confounding establishment of significance in biological contexts. These factors pose a growing need for novel data mining algorithms and techniques that are scalable, reliable, and interpretable.</p>
    
</div>

<div class="bio well"> 
    <h4>Biomedical Visualization and Interaction (BVI)</h4>
    <p><strong>Subunit lead - Dr Cvek, support Dr. Ullmer, Philip Kilgore</strong><br>

    <p>Visual analytics tools enabling the display and interaction with biomedical data are crucial to data exploration and actionable follow-up. The expertise contributed by the CBDA and BDMB subunits extends conventional statistical methodologies to newer data analysis methods including visual data mining and visual analytics of big biomedical data. The BVI subunit will support and extend visual analytics expertise at LBRN PUIs and peer BBCC sites.</p>
</div>

<div class="bio well">
    <h4>Communications Infrastructure and Training (CIT)</h4>
    <p><strong>Subunit lead - John I Quebedeaux Jr</strong><br>

    <p>A central objective and role of the overall LBRN project is bridging geographical distance to increase the effective critical mass, interchange, and impact of biomedical domain expertise. The CIT subunit serves a crosscutting enablement role between all three LBRN cores and the personnel of our PUI project teams.</p>

advertised services and fees. </p>

	<div class="bio well">
	<h4><a href="http://cobre.ceidr.lsu.edu/genelab.html">Molecular Biology Reagent Equipment and Services</a></h4>
    
	<p><strong>GeneLab</strong> currently provides conventional and NGS nucleic acid sequencing, recombinant DNA services, viral vector construction, quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis, and reagents and supplies needed for biotechnology experiments. GeneLab administers two freezer programs for Invitrogen, Inc., and Applied Biosystems, Inc., (now divisions of Thermofisher, Inc.) providing reduced costs (20-30% less than list prices) and immediate availability of research reagents. These reagents can be shipped to PUI laboratories. Research protocols and consultation for specific research projects are provided free of charge. GeneLab has recently implemented the internet-based software system (iLab) for scheduling equipment use and ordering reagents and services. This system has enabled practically full automation of all scheduling and accounting issues, effectively streamlining core laboratory operations and management. GeneLab provides multi-level assistance with recombinant DNA tasks and has successfully trained a number of PUI faculty and students in the effective use of these technologies free of charge, while specific projects are undertaken as fee-for-service activities.</p>
    
	<p><strong>NGS Services</strong>. Of particular interest to all LBRN investigators are GeneLab’s NGS support services in close collaboration with the BBCC and the LSU Center for Computation and Technology (CCT). GeneLab is co-supported by the MCBRC (molecular cell biology and NGS services) and by the BBCC (NGS bioinformatics services) and provides a reliable connection between NGS experiments and the analysis of the NGS data.</p>

	<p><strong>NGS Equipment</strong>. GeneLab is equipped with a suite of Life Technologies NGS equipment including Ion Torrent PGM, Ion Proton, and Quant Studio Flex (digital PCR validation). In addition, GeneLab has a variety of equipment to support NGS, including qPCR machines (ABI 7500 and 7900 and QuantStudio Flex systems); Fragment Analyzer from Advanced analytics to validated and quantify nucleic acid samples for NGS sample preparation; an epMotion robotic arm for high-throughput set-up and sampling; various computers and other equipment enabling quality control of nucleic acid samples and preparing nucleic acid extractions from many samples at once. GeneLab provides NGS methodologies (genomics, transcriptomics) in a strategic alliance with the BBCC. GeneLab operates Ion PGM and Ion Proton NGS equipment, which are linked to a local cluster having more than 200 terabytes of storage through dedicated high-end workstations. A visualization server supports Windows as well as Linux environments, providing memory intensive visualization tasks and tools working on both operating system (OS) environments. A computational server equipped with substantial memory (128 GB) and large number of cores (32) is networked to the Ion PGM and Ion Proton platforms for analyses requiring a large memory footprint and multi-core performance applications. These two high-end servers are backed by a network-connected expandable NAS storage system, which are directly connected to the servers and software tools integrated to the sequencing platforms, resulting in total storage space of over 120 Terabytes at this time. BBCC staff work closely with GeneLab to transfer and analyze data.</p>

	<h4><a href="http://www.cobre.ceidr.lsu.edu/protienlab.html">Protein Production, Purification, and Characterization Laboratory (PPPCL)</a></h4>
	<p>Currently, PPPCL focuses its support and development efforts in three areas: 1) protein production, purification, and characterization; 2) protein-protein interactions; 3) production of polyclonal protein-specific antibodies in mice and rabbits. PPPCL has access to other core facilities and equipment located within the Departments of Chemistry, and Biological Sciences, College of Sciences, for protein-protein interactions and protein analyses. Currently, PPPCL is fully equipped to handle a variety of protein expression, purification, and molecular biology experiments. PPPCL staff will design specific gene constructs carrying different epitope tags for detection or purification purposes. Specifically, affinity/fusion tags can be added to the N- or C-terminal portions of a protein (GST, His6, MBP, Thioredoxin-His6, GFP). Common epitope tags for detection purposes include: FLAG, V5, and HA among others. Specific proteolytic cleavages sites can be inserted to facilitate separation of the desired protein from a carrier protein. </p>

	<p><strong>Protein Purification and Characterization</strong>. The MCBRC primarily uses three semi-automated BioRad
Profinia affinity chromatography systems for small and larger scale purification, as well as conventional gravity columns. An AKTA Explorer FPLC system can execute different chromatography protocols. Many purification options, including standard reversed phase, affinity, and ion-exchange are available. Additional advanced high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultracentrifugation equipment are available within the collaborating Agricultural Biotechnology Laboratory (ABL) and the LSU Departments of Biological Sciences and Chemistry also located in Wilson Hall.</p>

	<p><strong>Peptide Synthesis and Purification</strong>. Large- and small-scale peptide synthesis utilize Protein Technologies Symphony and Tribute peptide synthesizers, both performing Fmoc synthesis and on-instrument cleavage of the peptide from the resin. Synthesis scales normally carried out in the facility are 25 μmol, 50 μmol, 100 μmol, and 250 μmol. Peptides are delivered as a lyophilized powder and include an analytical reverse-phase HPLC profile and a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrum.</p>

	<p><strong>Protein-Protein Interactions</strong>. The PPPCL assists researchers with conventional technologies used in proteinprotein interactions including co-immunoprecipitation, crosslinking, pull-down assays, far-western analysis, and utilization of commercial protein microarrays. State-of-the-art protein-protein interactions are investigated using primarily Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) implemented on Biacore and ForteBio SPR equipment. Additional physicochemical characterization of protein-protein interactions is available through collaborations with the LSU Department of Chemistry.</p>

	<p><strong>Gene-to-Protein-to-Antibody Service (GPAS)</strong>. PPPCL provides a unique service that includes cloning of immunogenic portions of a targeted protein typically 100-200 amino acids long or an entire gene into bacterial and mammalian expression vectors. These proteins can be expressed as fusion proteins with the Glutathione- S-Transferase (GST), maltose-binding protein (MBP), or other epitope tags, and are purified via automated affinity chromatography. Purified proteins without the carriers or epitope tags are then used to generate monospecific antibodies in either mice or rabbits. The entire GPAS is completed in approximately three months and results in the production of up to 100 ml of rabbit or 3-5 ml of mouse.</p>

	<div class="bio well">
  	<h4><a href="http://www.cobre.ceidr.lsu.edu/mipchome.html">Molecular Immunopathology Laboratory (MIPL) Services</a></h4>
  
	<p>Each MIPL-affiliated laboratory (described below) is currently set up to provide molecular immunopathology services and expertise to researchers on an individual basis. All expenses funded by the MCBRC (core funds, pilot funding) will be ordered through the internet-based iLab software, ensuring efficient scheduling and tracking of all activities and associated expenses. MCBRC will devote part of their budget to the development of specific assays that can be used by multiple researchers. These projects can be carried out only after review by the MCBRC leadership.</p>

	<p><strong>Pathology Services</strong> (LSU-SVM). Experienced, board-certified veterinary pathologists and pathology residents assist individual investigators in preforming necropsy procedures, gross and histopathological examinations, and interpretation of immunohistochemistry and special stains, as well as provide consultation on project design. Responsibilities include paraffin and frozen tissue processing, routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain, various special chemical stains, and advanced immunohistochemistry.</p>

<p><strong>Flow Cytometry and Immunophenotyping Services</strong> (LSU-FACS). The LSU Flow Cytometry Facility (LSUFACS) is located in a 263 sq. ft. laboratory on the third floor of the LSU-SVM building. The Flow Cytometry
Facility features a BD Biosciences FACScan, FACSCalibur, and FACSAria flow cytometers. The mission of
LSU-FACS is to supply state-of-the-art techniques and procedures for phenotypic as well as functional analysis
