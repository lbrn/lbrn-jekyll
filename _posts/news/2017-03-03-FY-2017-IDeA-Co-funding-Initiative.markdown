The IDeA Co-funding Initiative invites R01 and R15 submissions from NIH ICs.  The applications must be from institutions in IDeA-eligible states that were deemed meritorious in initial peer review, but are beyond the ICs payline. The NIH ICs that have primary assignment for the applications send their nominations to NIGMS for consideration.

*__Please be aware that the request for nominations to the FY2017 IDeA Co-funding Initiative has been issued internally to NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs).__*

**The deadline for nominations this year is COB April 6, 2016. The NIGMS/IDeA point of contact for this initiative is Dr. Rashada Alexander, Phone: 301-451-6416, E-mail: rashada.alexander@nih.gov**
